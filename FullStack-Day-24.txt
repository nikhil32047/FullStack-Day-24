Day 24:
==========

1) NumPy Module
======================
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python.
It provides the ndarray (N-dimensional array) which is faster and more memory-efficient than Python lists.
NumPy supports vectorized operations, mathematical functions, and linear algebra.

Example:
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(arr)

Why NumPy?
High performance
Less memory usage
Easy mathematical operations
Foundation for Pandas, ML, and Data Science


2) shape Attribute
==========================
shape returns the dimensions of an array as a tuple (rows, columns).

Example:
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                [4, 5, 6]])

print(arr.shape)   # (2, 3)


3) reshape() Method
==========================
reshape() changes the shape of an array without changing its data.
Total number of elements must remain the same.

Example:
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
new_arr = arr.reshape(2, 3)
print(new_arr)


Output:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]
